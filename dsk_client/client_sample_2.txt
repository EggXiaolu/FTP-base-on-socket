In this assignment, you require to implement two C programs, namely server and client to communicate
with each other based on TCP sockets. The goal is to implement a simple File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
Initially, server will be waiting for a TCP connection from the client. Then, client will connect to the
server using server’s TCP port already known to the client. After successful connection, the client should
be able to perform the following functionalities:
